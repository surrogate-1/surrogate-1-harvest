# surrogate-1 / frontend

**Diagnosis**
* The project lacks a robust implementation for handling Hugging Face API rate limits, which can block dataset training.
* There is inadequate reuse of existing Lightning Studio instances, leading to wasted quota and potential downtime.
* The frontend does not utilize the knowledge-rag pipeline for business research and contextual insights.
* The project does not leverage the existing Lightning Studio reuse pattern to save 80hr/mo quota.
* The frontend does not utilize the HF CDN bypass to download public dataset files without hitting the API rate limit.

**Proposed change**
* Implement the HF CDN bypass to download public dataset files without hitting the API rate limit.

**Implementation**
* Create a new file `frontend/utils.py` with the following code:
```python
import requests
import json

def get_cdn_file_list(repo, date_folder):
    url = f"https://huggingface.co/datasets/{repo}/resolve/main/{date_folder}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    return json.loads(response.content)
```
* Update the `train.py` file to use the `get_cdn_file_list` function to download the file list from the HF CDN:
```python
import utils

# ...

file_list = utils.get_cdn_file_list(repo, date_folder)
```
* Update the `train.py` file to use the file list from the CDN instead of making API calls to list the files:
```python
import utils

# ...

file_list = utils.get_cdn_file_list(repo, date_folder)
for file in file_list:
    # ...
```
**Verification**
* Run the `train.py` script and verify that it completes successfully without hitting the API rate limit.
* Check the logs to ensure that the file list is being downloaded from the HF CDN instead of making API calls to list the files.
* Verify that the training process is using the file list from the CDN to download the files.
